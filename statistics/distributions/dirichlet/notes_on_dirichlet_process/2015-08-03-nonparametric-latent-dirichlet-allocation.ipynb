    "# Nonparametric Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "_Latent Dirichlet Allocation_ is a [generative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model) model for topic modeling. Given a collection of documents, an LDA inference algorithm attempts to determined (in an unsupervised manner) the topics discussed in the documents. It makes the assumption that each document is generated by a probability model, and, when doing inference, we try to find the parameters that best fit the model (as well as unseen/latent variables generated by the model). If you are unfamiliar with LDA, Edwin Chen has a [friendly introduction](http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/) you should read.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because LDA is a _generative_ model, we can simulate the construction of documents by forward-sampling from the model. The generative algorithm is as follows (following [Heinrich](http://www.arbylon.net/publications/text-est.pdf)):\n",

    "* for each topic $k\\in [1,K]$ do\n",
    "    * sample term distribution for topic $\\overrightarrow \\phi_k \\sim \\text{Dir}(\\overrightarrow \\beta)$\n",
    "* for each document $m\\in [1, M]$ do\n",
    "    * sample topic distribution for document $\\overrightarrow\\theta_m\\sim \\text{Dir}(\\overrightarrow\\alpha)$\n",
    "    * sample document length $N_m\\sim\\text{Pois}(\\xi)$\n",
    "    * for all words $n\\in [1, N_m]$ in document $m$ do\n",
    "        * sample topic index $z_{m,n}\\sim\\text{Mult}(\\overrightarrow\\theta_m)$\n",
    "        * sample term for word $w_{m,n}\\sim\\text{Mult}(\\overrightarrow\\phi_{z_{m,n}})$\n",
    "        \n",
    "You can implement this with [a little bit of code](https://gist.github.com/tdhopper/521006b60e1311d45509) and start to simulate documents.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Sample a topic from the topic distribution for the document.\n",
    "2. Sample a word from the term distribution from the topic. \n",
    "\n",
