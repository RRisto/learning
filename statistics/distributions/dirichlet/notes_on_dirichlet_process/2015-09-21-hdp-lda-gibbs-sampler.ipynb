    "[Yee Whye Teh et al](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/papers/hdp.pdf)'s 2005 paper _Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes_ describes a nonparametric prior for grouped clustering problems. For example, the HDP helps in generalizing the [latent Dirichlet allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) model to the case the number of topics in the data are discovered by the inference algorithm instead of being specified as a parameter of the model.\n",

    "The authors describe three MCMC-based algorithms for fitting HDP based models. Unfortunately, the algorithms are described somewhat vaguely and in general terms.

    "$x_{ij}$ are observed data (words). We assume $x_{ij}\\sim F(\\theta_{ij})$. Further, we assume $\\theta_{ji}$ is associated with table $t_{ji}$, that is $\\theta_{ji}=\\psi_{jt_{ji}}$. Further, we assume the topic for table $j$ is indexed by $k_{jt}$, i.e. $\\psi_{jt}=\\phi_{k_{jt}}$. Thus, if we know $t_{ji}$ (the table assignment for $x_{ij}$) and $k_{jt}$ (the dish assignment for table $t$) for all $i, j, t$, we could determine the remaining parameters by sampling.\n",

    "Section 5.3 describes a direct assignment Gibbs sampler that directly assigns words to topics by augmenting the model with an assignment variable $z_{ji}$ that is equivalent to $k_{jt_{ji}}$.  This also requires a count variable $m_{jk}$: the number of tables in document/franchise $j$ assigned to dish/topic $k$. This sampler requires less \"bookkeeping\" than the algorithm from 5.1, however it requires expensive simulation or computation of recursively computed Stirling numbers of the first kind.\n",
