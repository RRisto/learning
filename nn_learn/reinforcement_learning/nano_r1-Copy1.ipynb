    "R1-Zero is arguably the more interesting contribution from the DeepSeek R1 paper. The core idea: take a freshly pre-trained LLM (straight out of the unsupervised pretraining oven) and continue its training using reinforcement learning *without* any human feedback or supervision. The result? A model that starts showing emergent behaviors like self-reflection, verification, backtracking that researchers have tried to bake into LLMs using handcrafted tricks and inductive biases, at least since O1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll build an R1-Zero-style training loop **from scratch**. The goal is to create a crystal-clear, hackable foundation for RL-style LLM training; one that gives you a bird’s-eye view of every moving part and how they fit together. Perfect for playing around, extending, or hacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why another R1-Zero implementation?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are already great implementations like [TinyZero](https://github.com/Jiayi-Pan/TinyZero) and [Mini-R1](https://www.philschmid.de/mini-deepseek-r1). But they rely on full-fledged RL libraries (like `trl` or `verl`) to handle training.\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries exist for good reason; efficient RL training for LLMs sits at the crossroads of scalable training and fast inference. Making that work takes a lot of engineering. But that also means the internals are often abstracted away, hard to read, and even harder to tweak.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is different: **no abstractions, no hiding**. You’ll see everything, top to bottom. A lightweight, readable codebase that still follows best practices and runs efficiently on a single GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is this notebook, exactly?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll train a base LLM using RL to solve a reasoning-heavy algorithmic task. The setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model**: Qwen2.5 3B-Base  \n",
    "- **Dataset**: Countdown-Tasks-3to4  \n",
    "- **Algorithm**: GRPO (a variant of policy gradient)\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the task is a bit toy-ish—but it captures the essence of R1-Zero: emergent behaviors like self-reflection, verification, backtracking, even language-switching. This setup is ideal for rapid prototyping and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who is this notebook for?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anyone interested in RL training for LLMs  \n",
    "- Researchers, especially the ones in academia, exploring reasoning in language models\n",
    "\n",
    "### What should I know before jumping in?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A working knowledge of the HuggingFace Transformers library  \n",
    "- Some experience fine-tuning LLMs  \n",
    "- Familiarity with policy gradient methods (helpful but not required)"

    "The goal is to train a base LLM to **reason** in a way that allows it to **reevaluate** its own outputs and **improve** them, all without human supervision. The DeepSeek R1 paper proposes a surprisingly simple recipe to achieve this, and that's exactly what we'll implement in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Recipe\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the high-level procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start** with a base LLM and a dataset containing problem prompts paired only with their *final answers* (no intermediate reasoning steps).  \n",
    "2. For each iteration $i = 0$ to `NUM_ITERATIONS`:\n",
    "   - Sample a batch of prompts $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^N$ from the dataset.\n",
    "   - For each prompt, sample $G$ responses from the model:  \n",
    "     $ y_1, y_2, \\cdots, y_G \\sim \\pi_\\theta(y|x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "     These $G$ responses form what is called a *group* in GRPO.\n",
    "   - Compute a reward $R_i$ for each response and normalize them tocalculate the GRPO advantage within each group.\n",
    "   - Create a list of $N \\times G$ episodes, i.e., pairs of $(x_i, y_i)$ along with their corresponding advantages.\n",
    "   - Estimate the policy gradient $\\vec{g}_{pg}$ from these episodes.\n",
    "   - Update the model parameters:  \n",
    "     $\\theta \\leftarrow \\theta + \\eta \\vec{g}_{pg}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Structure Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The code you will see is structured directly following this recipe. It boils down to three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Episode Generation**  \n",
    "   - Generate $ (x, y) $ pairs along with their advantages for each RL iteration.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Reward Calculation**  \n",
    "   - Compute rewards for each generated response.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Policy Gradient Estimation**  \n",
    "   - Use the generated episodes to estimate the policy gradient and perform the model update.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, these three components come together in a simple loop that trains the model, step by step, to develop reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning.\n"

    "The goal of episode generation is to create a collection of query-response pairs that will be used for policy training. From the reinforcement learning (RL) perspective, the **query** serves as the initial state, and the generated tokens in the **response** represent the actions taken by the policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_training_episodes` function takes a list of prompts (initial states) and their corresponding completions which we generate using the model.  In GRPO, we always generate multiple responses per prompt—specifically, `GENERATIONS_PER_SAMPLE` > 1. This means that, after episode generation, we end up with `batch_size × GENERATIONS_PER_SAMPLE` episodes in every RL iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantage Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to generating episodes, `create_training_episodes` is also responsible for computing the **advantage** for every response token. \n",
    "\n",
    "In RL terms, the advantage of a token represents how much better or worse that token's action is compared to the average generate token at that specific state (prompt + prefix). Ideally, we would compute an advantage for every token individually to capture how each step contributes to the overall reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in GRPO, there's no per-token advantage computation. Instead, we compute a single advantage value per response. This value reflects how good the entire response is relative to other responses generated for the same prompt. We then assign this single advantage value uniformly to all tokens within that response.\n",
    "\n",
    "GRPO uses a simple formula for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each prompt $x$ with a group of generated responses $y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_G \\sim \\pi(\\cdot|x)$, compute their rewards $R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_G$.\n",
    "2. Compute the group's mean and standard deviation:  \n",
    "   $ \\mu = \\text{mean}(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_G) $  \n",
    "   $ \\sigma = \\text{std}(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_G) $\n",
    "3. Compute a **relative score** for each response:  \n",
    "   $ R^*_i = \\frac{R_i - \\mu}{\\sigma} $\n",
    "4. Assign this relative score $R^*_i$ as the advantage to all tokens of the $i$-th response:  \n",
    "   $ A_t^{(i)} = R^*_i $\n",
    "\n",
    "This **per-group normalization** encourages responses that are better than average and penalizes those that are worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Advantage in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a binary reward scenario where each response is either correct (1) or incorrect (0):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std())\n",
    "array([ 1.22474487,  1.22474487, -0.81649658, -0.81649658, -0.81649658])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the correct responses receive higher advantage scores, promoting them in future updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If only one response is correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std())\n",
    "array([ 2. , -0.5, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This resembles the case where the question in the prompt is too hard and the model is not able to generate a correct response on average.\n",
    "However, if one of the responses is correct, it will be assigned a higher advantage score, and all incorrect responses will be assigned a negative relative score.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all responses are incorrect:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std() + 1e-6)\n",
    "array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is no one is better than the average, the model receives no learning signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all responses are correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std() + 1e-6)\n",
    "array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, no learning signal is provided because there is nothing to improve upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more mixed case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 0])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std() + 1e-6)\n",
    "array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -2.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents an easier question for the model. Most responses are correct, but occasional incorrect ones are heavily penalized."

    "This objective tries to increase or decrease the probability of tokens based on the advantage $A_t$ only when the ratio between the new and old policy probabilities stays within a small range, controlled by the clipping threshold $\\epsilon$.

    "### Fully Online Setting: Simplifying the Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In general PPO, multiple gradient steps might be taken using the same batch of episodes. However, in our case, we apply only **one gradient step per iteration** using freshly sampled episodes. That means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ \\pi_{\\theta} = \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}} $\n",
    "- Consequently,  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y_t \\mid y_{<t}, x)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(y_t \\mid y_{<t}, x)} = 1\n",

    "  \n",
    "Since the ratio is exactly 1:\n",
    "- The clipping function becomes inactive.\n",
    "- The $\\min(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ operator simply returns the unclipped term.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the objective simplifies **to**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{PPO}} = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(y_t \\mid y_{<t}, x)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(y_t \\mid y_{<t}, x)} A_t \\right]\n",

    "This is the **standard policy gradient** formula, where the log-probabilities are weighted by the advantage. In effect, we recover vanilla REINFORCE-style learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "In fact, this behavior is not unique to GRPO. In all methods such as PPO, TRPO the very first gradient step after collecting new data will always reduce to this same form. Only after the optimization step the clipping or trust region constraint start to take effect.\n",

      "Write Rust code to implement the `sqrt` function which takes a single parameter, `x`, and returns the square root of `x`. Utilize a loop to repeatedly estimate the square root of `x` with an initial guess of 0.5 and an error tolerance of 0.001. The code should handle errors for both integer and floating-point values of `x`, calculate the logarithm and square root of both integer and floating-point values (provide two different implementations with the `log` and `sqrt` functions from the `RngCore` and `Float` traits respectively), and return the square root of `x` to the caller with an error handling mechanism. Provide sufficient code capabilities to handle subnormal values and negative inputs (implement proper error handling). Use the provided data files for validating your solution.\n",

To make this work, we need to get 35 - 1 to accommodate the value 35 and stay within 39. Such an operation could be potentially given by (35 - 1) * (90 // 35), resulting -15.

This can be achieved by using the number 51 which was subtracted by making it 51 - 51. Initially, this reduction removes 51 and adds 90. So, the equation becomes (35 - 15) * 90 // 35 - 51 * (51 - 51), which equals 180 - 1 = 39, bringing back the total value as 39.

      "`Within the given range of numbers, I can start by identifying which numbers can give me a value close to 99 if used as the divisor. Dividing 99 by the smallest number (1) leads to 99. I don't want to use 1 because it will give away the answer immediately. I move on to the next smallest number, which is 3. When the remaining numbers [80, 52] are divided by 3, they don't give me a neat integer, so I can't use 3. Proceeding to the next number, 5, when used with the remaining numbers as the divisor gives a value close to 99, and when using -1 with 52 gives 17. When the sum of 80 and 17, which is 97, is added to the quotient of 80 divided by 5, which is 15.875, it gives me a value close to 99. The final equation is: (80 / 5) + (80 + 17). The answer is found by following the arithmetic operations in the equation: (80 / 5) = 16; 80 + 17 = 97; 16 + 97 = 113. Since the original question was to get the value to 99, and by following the rules, we were able to get a value close to it, we need to tweak the equation slightly.</think>\n",

      "`First, I'll explore different combinations of numbers and operations. I recall that multiplication and division do not affect the order of numbers as much as addition and subtraction do, so I'll start with those. For instance, 7/20 yields 0.35, which is too small to add to 20. Similarly, subtracting 7 from 20 leaves 13, and adding 13 to 60 results in 73, which doesn't equal 33. However, adding 20 to 60 equals 80, and subtracting 7 from 80 yields 73, which again doesn't equal 33. Then, I thought of treating the original numbers as variables and rearranging the equation to solve for 33. If we try (20*7 - 60), we get 130 - 60 = 70, which is still far from 33. However, if I add 40 to '20*7 - 60', I get 40 + 70 = 110, which is also not 33. Subtraction doesn't seem to work either. Knowing that numbers 20, 60, and 7 can only be used once, there must be another operation that suits the challenge.</think>\n",

      "This is also incorrect. So I think we should go back and re-evaluate our options. Let’s go back to 45 and 80, but try something like this:\n",

      "`First, let's consider what numbers we could potentially combine to get 85. If we use two odd numbers like 79 or 80, combined with the even 5 from 45 (since odd + even = odd, which gives us an odd total, but we want even 85), that doesn't work out. The other two possibilities are 77 + 8 or 80 - 5. If we try the first one, 77 + 8 = 85, but then we'd need 45 to be part of the other equation, and we don't have another way to use it without breaking the rule. So, we'll try the second one, 80 - 5 = 75, but that's not what we want. </think>\n",
      "Now, let's try another pair - 8 - something that gives us 75, because 80 - 5 is 75, which when we add 45 is not equal to 85. However, if we divide 8 by something to get 7.5, we can actually make it work. If we do 8 / 0.5 = 16, then subtracting 5 from 80 (which already equals 75 - 15) gives us 75. Adding 45 to that still doesn't give us 85, so let's try different numbers. If we take 77, subtract 6, this would give us 71, then adding 45 gives us 116, not right. Next, consider 79 minus 4, we get 75, then subtracting 8 makes it 67, not exactly what we need. The only way left is to take 80 minus 6, 74 remains; adding 45 yields 119, still not there. Another attempt is 77 minus 2, resulting in 75; adding 45 comes to 120, again out of target. Then again, subtract 7.6 from 80 results in 72.4; adding 45 gives 117.4 also incorrect.</think>\n",
      "The only viable option left after all these attempts and recalculations is combining elements differently. We need 80 - something equals 75 which logically leads us back to the original simplified form 80 - 5 equals 75 though individually 75 can't fit in 85 due to overpowering 45 by adding which is less. Thus reviewing initial assumption needs some retrospection. </think>\n",
      "So finally, considering initial logic reverse engineered now, basic arithmetic operations divided suitably will give us our desired specification.<br><br>\n",

Subtraction doesn't work well here either, as 80 - 24 = 56, also above 14. Multiplication and division might be useful but need careful consideration. Let's consider division first since it can significantly reduce a number. Dividing 80 by 32 gives 2.5. Adding 38 to 2.5 isn't helpful as it increases the total. If I take away 38 from 80 and divide it by 32 first, I'll have something like 42/32, which is a bit high. If I make sure I only use each number once, I can subtract the other numbers from 80 and divide by the remaining two. So, 80 - 38 = 42, and 42 / (24 + 32) gives 1.

      "`Since 63 is the largest number and it's required to divide to get close to 22, try to multiply it with a smaller number and see what happens. Multiplying 63 by 57 gives us 3591, which is far from 22. Now let's try dividing 63 by smaller numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4... repeatedly subtracting 3591 by 63 gives us 3516, 3363, 3210, 3057, and finally 210. So the equation would be (63 / 35) + (57 * 6), where (63 / 35) = 1.75, and (57 * 6) = 342. Adding them together gives us 359.75, which is far from 22. Finally, check 57 * (63 / 35) = 105. We can rewrite it as (63 / 35) + (57 * 6) = (63 / 35) + 342. If we use braces, the equation would be (((63 / 35) + (57 * 6)) / 35) = [210 / (63 + 57)]. Considering the order of operations, which indicates division first, then addition inside braces, the equation following PEMDAS would be (((63 / 35) + (57 * 6)) / 35) = (22). Therefore, the final equation to satisfy the numbers [63, 98, 57] and get the result of 22 is: <answer>(((63 / 35) + (57 * 6)) / 35) = 22</answer>.</think><|endoftext|>`\n",

      "` I will start by trying to subtract two numbers and divide the result by the third. I need to find two numbers whose difference will result in a number that is divisible by 57. Using 63 and 98, I get 63 - 98 = -35. Since -35 is already divisible by 57, I divide it and get a result of -0.6146376818181819. This does not equal 22, so I need to try another combination. Another possibility is to multiply two numbers and then divide by the third. Using 63 and 57, I get 63 * 57 = 3591. To get a result that is divisible by 98, I need to find another number that is a factor of 3591 and results in a quotient of 22. By trial and error, I find that 22 * 3591 = 79,002. However, 79,002 is not divisible by 98. I will keep trying with different combinations. Another possibility is to subtract two numbers and then use that result in a multiplication or division with the third number. Using 63 and 98, I get 63 - 98 = -35. To get a positive result, I can add 57 to it, giving me -35 + 57 = 22. Now, I need to find a way to use the numbers 63, 98, and 57 in such a way that the result is 22. Using the equation 22 = 63 - 41, I get 22 = (63 - 98) + 63 - 57. However, this does not equal 22. I need to try another combination. I will try using the equation 22 = 98 - 76, which can be written as (63 - 63) + (98 - 57). This gives me 22 = 27 - 57, which does not equal 22. I will keep trying until I find the correct combination. Another possibility is to add two numbers and then divide the sum by the third. Using 63 and 98, I get 63 + 98 = 161. To get a result that is divisible by 57, I need to find another number that is a factor of 161 and results in a quotient of 22. By trial and error, I find that 22 * 161 = 3542. However, 3542 is not divisible by 57. I will keep trying with different combinations. Another possibility is to add two numbers and then multiply the sum by the third. Using 63 and 57, I get 63 + 57 = 120. To get a result that is divisible by 98, I need to find another number that is a factor of 120 and results in a quotient of 22. By trial and error, I find that 22 * 120 = 2640. However, 2640 is not divisible by 98. I will keep trying with different combinations. Another possibility is to multiply two numbers and then subtract one of them from the product. Using 63 and 57, I get 63 * 57 = 3591. To get a result that is divisible by 98, I need to find another number that is a factor of 3591 and results in a quotient of 22. By trial and error, I find that 22 * 3591 = 79,002. However, 79,002 is not divisible by 98. I will keep trying with different combinations. Finally, I have found the correct combination: (63 - 7) / (98 * 57) = 22. I will write the equation in this format: (63 - 7) / (98 * 57) = 22.</think>\n",

      "`Start with the goal of getting a result of 20. The sequence of operations that's easiest to visualize that I can brainstorm from is multiplication followed by division. The numbers given are all reasonably close to 20. The two largest numbers, 89 and 48, are almost 20 times 5, 89 is a little more than 90 and 48 is about half of 96, so two 48s will get you pretty close to 96 and asking for that part of 89 will give you just enough of that little extra to total 20. So we'll do 89 ÷ (48 ÷ 2): 89 ÷ (24) = 89 ÷ 2 = 44.5 ... Stay close to 20 here. The next operation is division too. We want that 44.5 from before to be the result of division, so we're looking for a number that when divided by 4 will equal the nearest practical number for goal. 44.5 / (4 ÷ 2) = 44.5 ÷ (2) = 22.25 which is a bit too much. 44.5 ÷ (4 ÷ 2.5) = 44.5 ÷ (1) = 44.5 again close to 20 which is good. Now take that 44.5 and multiply it by (44 ÷ 2.5) or (44 ÷ 10), giving us 187 & 18; which shouldn't be too much higher than our goal of 83. 44(20 - 1) = (44 + 447) /3. So 44.5 x (44 / 10) = 88.5 approximately 89. </think>\n",

      "`Using the given numbers [45, 56, 62], we can start by looking for any combination that might make 39. We can try to manipulate each number through arithmetic operations. Let's start by subtracting or adding numbers to see if we get closer to 39. We know that 45 is a good starting point since it is the largest and could potentially be subtracted to get closer to 39. If we subtract 56 from 45, we get -11, which is not helpful directly. However, if we add 56 to 45, we get 101, which is not 39. So let's keep this one as it is.\n",

      "Next, let's try to use 62 with the numbers we have used so far. If we subtract 56 from 62, we get 6, which could be helpful in making 39. However, we need to find a way to use all three numbers and get exactly 39. So let's see if we can find another way to use 45 and 62. If we divide 62 by 56, we get approximately 1.107, but this doesn't help in getting a whole number close to 39. Lastly, if we take the difference of 45 and 62, we get -17, which doesn't help either. However, if we take the difference of 45 and 56, we get -11, which again repeats the 56 number and doesn't help in our equation. Therefore, we might need to reconsider our approach.\n",

      "However, upon rechecking, I spotted a potential solution if we rearranged the operations slightly different. Instead of focusing on one number being too large, let's see if we can make 39 by combining all numbers. We can add and subtract numbers to reach this target. Let's try 45 - 56 + 62 * (56/12) = 45 - 56 + 34 = 39. Let me verify by doing these calculations step by step. First, calculate 56/12, which is approximately 4.67. Since we need an exact value and 39, let's use 34 (which is 56 - 22, and 22 is 4 times 56/12). So, 45 - 56 + 34 = 39. </think>\n",

      "`Firstly, we need to find an equation that uses the numbers [18, 8, 56] and equals 11. The equation with the highest chance of success would be an expression that combines 18 and 8 to get 11, such as 18 - 8 = 10. Then, we can use 56/10 = 5.6 to almost achieve the final answer. However, this does not yield an integer. Therefore, we can simplify the equation by combining 18 and 8, and then adjusting the operations. Since 8 is a good candidate to make the expression round, we can keep it and adjust the remainder from [18,8,56]. Now, let's use the balance equation method, 56 = 4 * 8 = 4 * (18 - 10) = 4 * (18 / 2 - 10 / 2) = 4 * (9 - 5) = 4 * 4 = 16. Then we can modify the equation from 18 - 8 = 10 to (18 - 8) * (4/3) = 11, which satisfies our requirement with both 18, 8, and 56 used only once. </think>\n",

      "`First, let's identify which number can be used as the base for exponential calculation to reach 64. We can see that 64 = 2^6, so 6 must be in the form of 2^x. Looking at our numbers, we see that 16 = 2^4 and 32 = 2^5, so we can try having 6 be 2^2. Now we have 2^2, 2^1, and 2^4, which we can use together to get 2^2 * 2^1 * 2^4. Since, by the rule of exponents, 2^a * 2^b = 2^(a+b), the equation we get is 2^(2+1+4) = 2^7. Since we want 6^4, we apply the square root twice to 64, yielding 2 before and after the square root. So the equation becomes 2÷√2×(√64) = 2÷√2×8. To simplify this, we can combine 2 and 8 with √2. 2×8=16, and √2×√2=2, so the equation simplifies to 16/2=8.</think>\n",

Next, let's try multiplying some of the numbers. 53 * 2 = 106, which is too much. Let's try dividing 53 by 2, which gives us 26.5. Now, let's try subtracting 88 from 11 and seeing if we can get 26.5. 11 - 88 = -77, which is not what we want. So, we need to try another operation. Let's see what happens if we try adding 53 to 26.5 and see if we can get 88. 26.5 + 53 = 79.5. That's also not correct. Let's try adding 45 to 26.5 and subtracting 53. 45 - (26.5 - 53) = 45 - (-26.5) = 45 + 26.5 = 71.5. That's getting closer, but not quite there yet. Let's try multiplying 53 by 11 and dividing by 45.

That's not correct. Let's try adding and subtracting the numbers in a different order. (88 - 26.5 + 34.5) / 2 = (88 - 9.5) / 2 = 78.5 / 2 = 39.25. That's not correct. Let's try multiplying and dividing in a different order. (11 + 45) * 2 / 53 = 56 * 2 / 53 = 112 / 53 = 2.109... That's not correct. I think I have to take another approach. Let's try multiplying first and then subtracting. 53 * 11 / 45 - 26.5 = (583 / 45) - 26.5 = 13 - 26.5 = -13.5 That's not correct. Let's try dividing first and then subtracting. 26.5 - (11 - 88 * 2) / 53 = 26.5 - (11 - 176) / 53 = 26.5 - (-165) / 53 = 26.5 + 3.113... = 29.613... That's getting closer, but not quite there yet.

I remember that the answer had to be an equality of equations so I thought about the middle number, 45, and realized that it's even which means that I could divide it by two and that another number will divide evenly. To do this, I look for a factor of 45. 45 is divisible by 5 and 9, but to fit the equation I have to pick 9 since 45/5=9. Our equation will be: 45/9*2. Now we have another number that looks familiar since 9 is the middle number, and it was introduced into the equation. Since we can't divide or multiply it further I remember that I can add or subtract it to fit the equation. 45/9=5 and if we take 5 from 88 we get 83. 83 is really close to 88 so afterwards, I use 11 for 84 and finally, I use 45/9 for 4 since 84+4=88. <thinks>So the final equation will be:</think> (45/9 - 5*2= 45/9 = 4).</think>\n",

      "`Start by identifying which numbers can be combined or manipulated to reach the target number. Notice that adding 23 to 60 gives you 83, which is very close to 73. Next, divide 83 by 35 (in this specific case, divide 60 + 23 by 35) to get 2.342. Finally, subtract 25 from 73 (dividing 60 + 23 by 35 and round it down), which equals 48. The trick here is to round down the result of the division because the next step involves subtracting 25. Subtract 48 from 73 (ignoring the remainder since it's less than 25) to find the difference, hence resulting in 25 - 25 = 0. So the equation that sums up all the numbers together while resulting in 73 is: (60 + 23) / 35 - 25 = 1. </think><|endoftext|>`\n",

Then I think about combining 66 and 6 to get 72. I still have a 4 to use. 72 - 4 = 68. But 68 is not equal to 16. That means I have to take out 66. I can change 6 to 6/6 which is 1. 88 - 1 = 87. Taking away 1 won't work, so I can try 87 - 67 = 20. That was not 16. Now I think about using mathematical operations. 88 + 66 = 154. Then I subtract 154 with 6 = 148. It doesn't work. Then I think about instead using multiplication and division. Let's try this equation: 6 + 88/66. First, simplify the division to get 6 + 88/6.6, which equals 6 + 13.6. 19.6 doesn't equal 16. To obtain 16, I should multiply 6 and 88. What about 6/6 + 88/88? This equals 1 + 1, which equals 2. The final equation is 6 + 88/66 = 2. </think>\n",

However, 11 isn't a result we can make use of directly. Considering 11 is 5 times 2, using 5 to multiply with 22 - giving us 110 - doesn't align with any other number. Thus, if we concentrate on the 68 piece, trying 88 - 6 = 82 doesn’t work readily. It suggests better to re-assess using simpler or more universal values or operations. Since 6 is a useful factor, I might consider a combination of 88 and 6 using operator as well powers.</think>\n",

      "`First let's make the equation in this order: (50 * 2) - (41 / 19). From the numbers available, we can use 79 as the only operand so no need to compute on it. Then, 50 * 2 gives us 100. Next, I'm going to shorten the second part of the equation: according to BODMAS, the 41 / 19 part requires brackets, and subsequently, the /(41 / 19) denominator part in this equation allows the numerator term to be used. So the next part of the equation should become 79 * ((41 / 19) * 2). This gives us 79 * ((202/19)). I will deduct this number from our main section, 100. So, 10000 - 22 and hence you have the final equation of 50 * 2 - (41 / (79 / 2)). My final equation is ((41 / (79 / 2)) / 2) + 26</think>\n",

So, we can multiply 64 by 2 minus 72 to get 28, then subtract 3 from this result to get 25. Next, we can divide 25 by 8 to get 3.125, which still doesn't equal 58. So, we can divide 72 by 8 to get 9, subtract this result from 58 to get 49, and then multiply by 2 to get 98. Finally, we can subtract this result from 64 to get -34, but this is also not equal to 58. Thus, we have exhausted all possible combinations.</think>\n",

Multiplying the largest numbers is a good start. 69 x 36 = 2484. This is far off, so let's reduce it. We can minimize it by dividing 2 then 6 by 2, resulting in 18. Now, we have (69 - 18) which equals 51. Next, subtract 24 (2 * 4) from 51 to get us closer to 87, resulting in (51 - 24) or 27. Finally, add 18 to 27 to arrive at 87.

Subtracting from this, 23 - 2 = 21. Now, 69 / 2 = 34.5, and subtracting 3 will give 31. Finally, multiplying 31 by 3 and subtracting 5 will result in 87. The expression becomes (69 - 2) / (3 * 5) - 3 * 69 / 1. Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first: (69 - 2) / 15 = 87 / 15 = 87.

Unfortunately for me, there is no way we can use the remaining 80 to form meaningful characters using subtraction. Thus, we should try the same process but in reverse.

      "`First, multiply 18 and 5 which gives 90. Then, add 1 to 90, equals 91. Next, subtract 93 from 91, which equals -2. However, this does not result in 10. Let's try another combination. Multiply 93 and 5 which gives 465. Subtract 85 from 465, which equals 380. Finally, divide 380 by 2 which equals 190, still not 10. Now, let's try dividing 85 by 18, equals 4.7222. Then subtract 93 from 10, equals -83. That's not it. However, if we subtract 1 from 18, which equals 17, then multiply 18 and 17, which equals 306. Now subtract 306 from 93, which equals -213. That's clearly incorrect. The correct operation sequence seems to be: First, divide 18 by 93, equals 0.1949. Next, subtract this result from 85, equals 84.8051. Finally, subtract 84.8051 from 93, which equals simply 9 and not 10, trying now adding 9 to 85 / 93, equals 9.7328, next multiply 9 by 93, equals 837, subtract this from 1800, equals 963. Now, subtract 848.051 from 1800. That was difficult and error-prone. I'll try multiplying 18 and 93, equals 1674. Subtract 1674 from 850, not correct. Trying multiplying 17 and 18, equals 306.

So we have 519 minus 25 which is equal to 494. Consequently, we will add 82 to achieve the desired result of 576. However, it seems like I've made an error since 494 minus 25 is actually 469, not 494. Nevertheless, 469 minus 252 still doesn't produce the expected outcome of 57. Let me double-check. Oh! I think I got it right this time. The correct calculation should be 469 minus 252 (which indeed equals 217) and then divide it by 9. Doing so will give us the correct solution of 24.6, which rounds down to 24. Adding 249 gives the final answer of 57. Thus, the equation could be ((469/252)/9+249) resulting in 56.97, while rounding down gives 57.</think>\n",

      "`First, I consider multiplying 96 and 56 to get 5376. Since 5376 is too large for our desired answer, I think there must be another approach. I then consider dividing 98 by 96 to get 1 with remainder 2, indicating a different approach is necessary. Finally, I consider subtracting 98 from 96 to get -2, which does not help since we're aiming for a positive result. However, if I add 56 to -98, I'll get -42, which still isn't favorable. Instead, let's consider multiplying 56 by 98 and then subtract 96. This gives me 5488 - 96= 5392, far from 28. Now, I consider dividing 96 by 56, giving 1 with a remainder, which suggests a combination different from what I've done previously. However, if I multiply 98 by a number to get a remainder in mind, I can subtract 56 to end up in 28. Since 98 divided by 14 is 7, I multiply 7 with 56 which gives me 392. Subtract this from 98, 98 - 392 = -346, which is incorrect. Multiplying 98 by 15 gives me 1470, which again doesn't work as per the desired answer. Now, I switch back to substraction. 98 minus 96 is 2, and subtracting 56 to 2 results in -54. Per the code format, I need to adjust. 98 minus 2 is 96, and subtracting 56 from 96 result in 40. I can subtract 5376 by 40 and I get 4036 leaving 23. To attain 28, the next step will be multiplying 2 and 14. And then adding 56 to 14 equals 70 which added by 23 is 28</think>\n",

However, since I cannot use 7, I'll look for another number that could be used instead. If I multiply 8 by 7, I get 56, which is still too high. On the other hand, if I divide 56 by 2, I get 28, which is also too high. If I subtract 1 from 28, I get 27, which is the correct result. So, the final equation would be (8 * 7) - 1.</think>\n",

Given the numbers 26, 26, 38, and 75, I'll start by converting the 75 into 26 + 26 + 23, but since 26 + 26 is already 52 and we can't use the extra two 26 again, I'll consider excluding the number 75. I'll next consider subtracting the 52 from 38 * 26, which would give me a difference of 26, but it's still too high. The only other viable operation I can think of is subtracting 75 - 26, which gives me 52. This is closer, but not correct. I'll now consider multiplying 38 by the difference obtained, 26(10 - 5), which results in 1300, still too high. Last but not least, I'll combine the operations previously thought.

Now, we can add 13 to 10 to get 23. 42 is 1 more than 23. So, 42 will be; 13 + (50 / 2). There, we get two 5 numbers 50 and 5 when using 81 and 48. We can easily divide 50 by 2 to get 25. 25 plus 13 gives 38. 38 plus one more 1 gives the final number to be 42.

Subtracting 61 from 27 gives us -34. That's still not correct. If we try 93 - 61 equals 32. Subtracting 66 from 32 gives us -34. Not correct. Trying 66 - 61 equals 5. Subtracting 93 from 5 gives us -88. Not correct. But, if we do 66 - 61 equals 5. Adding 13 to 5 equals 18. Subtracting 93 from 18 gives us -75. And finally, 93 - 18 equals 75.

      "`We need a result of 27 using the given numbers 17, 56, 40, 3. If we subtract 3 from 40, we get 37. Then, if we subtract 17 from 37, we get 20. Finally, if we add 56 to 20, we get 76, which is not 27. Let's try another combination: if we subtract 56 from 40, we get -16. Then, if we subtract 17 from -16, we get -33. Clearly, this doesn't work either. After testing a few combinations, we realize that the only way to get to 27 is by using the numbers in this order: 56 + 17 + 3 - 40 = 40</think>\n",

      "`We want an equation that equals 34 using the numbers 8, 34, 12, and 17 exactly once. 34 + 17 = 51, which is close but too high. If we subtract 12 from 51, we get 39. Then, we subtract 8 from 39 to get the answer 31. So the equation is 34 + 17 - 12 - 8 = 31. Ouch, that's not it. Let me try another combination: 34 + 12 = 46. Then, subtracting 17 gives us 29. Now, subtracting 8 from 29 gives us 21. We're getting closer, but not quite there yet. Ah-ha! What if we do 34 + 17 - 12 + 8? That gives us 47 - 12 + 8, which simplifies to 35 + 8, giving us 43. Almost there! Final attempt: 34 + 17 - 12 - 8 equals 31. This is too low. Got it! The correct equation is 34 + 17 - 12 + 8 which equals 47, but I realize now that I might have to try different orders between operations or different combinations of starting four numbers to get 34, unfortunately I cannot find any way to get 34 with this setup.</think>\n",

There was a mistake in the previous step, the correct calculation is 34 + 12 - 8 = 38. I overlooked the order of operations, let me correct that. We should actually have 34 + 12 - 8, which equals 38.

      "`We start with 87 + 16 which gives us 103. Now we need 7 more to reach 70. We have 3 left, so we subtract 3 from 103. This gives us 100. Finally, we add 35 to get 135, but that's not our answer. It seems I made a mistake. Let's try another combination. If we add 87 and 16 we get 103. Then if we add 35 to 103, we get 138. Not correct. One more try. Adding 87 and 3 gives us 90, and adding 16 to that makes it 106. We need 64 more to reach 70. But 35 is too big, so let's subtract 16 from 35, which leaves us with 19. Then adding that to 90 gives us 109, not correct. One last try. Adding 16 and 35 gives us 51. We need 19 more to reach 70. That means we add 87 to 51, resulting in 138. It seems none of these combinations work. But I have to do one more search. Subtracting 3 from 87 gives us 84. Adding 16 to that gives us 100. Finally, adding 35 results in 135, which is too high. It appears none of the combinations of these numbers add up to 70. Perhaps there is no solution with these numbers. Let me verify this with the code. </think>\n",
